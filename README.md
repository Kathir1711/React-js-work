work that had done on react JS frontend web development hand on training


React Experience

 Hands-On Training with Yardstick Academy

I have completed extensive hands-on training in front-end development with React.js through Yardstick Academy. This training allowed me to deeply explore the following areas:

React.js Fundamentals: Gained practical experience in building dynamic, responsive user interfaces using React. This includes understanding component lifecycle, state management, and props.

JavaScript Proficiency: Enhanced my JavaScript skills by working with modern ES6+ features, asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await, and leveraging JavaScript's core concepts to solve real-world problems.

Component-Based Architecture: Developed reusable and maintainable components, focusing on the principles of component-driven development. Applied state management techniques and hooks to manage application state efficiently.

Frontend Development Practices: Implemented best practices for front-end development, including code splitting, lazy loading, and performance optimization. Worked on creating a seamless user experience with responsive design principles.

Project Showcase: Contributed to a front-end project where I applied React.js to build a comprehensive web application. This project involved designing intuitive interfaces, integrating APIs, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

Feel free to check out my repositories for examples of my work and the skills Iâ€™ve applied during this training.
